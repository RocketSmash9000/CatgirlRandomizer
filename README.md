# Catgirl Randomizer
**An ap made by a weeb, for weebs.**

Catgirl Randomizer pulls a random image from [nekos.moe](https://nekos.moe) and displays it to you.

This app was based heavily on [Catgirl Downloader](https://github.com/NyarchLinux/CatgirlDownloader), but with some extra features and for every operating system.
